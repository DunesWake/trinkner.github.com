thoughts I'm mulling over
  while scrolling show info on work, when stop scrolling it dissapears
  should artists have control over settings such as aliasing ?
  should the viewing space adhere to the same render settings across artists ?
  user not allowed to view on mobile
  user controlled zoom in / out / general control
  force fullscreen on desktop
  AR that places a form the second it maps a large plain, the user can only restart this process. they cannot place the form themselves.
