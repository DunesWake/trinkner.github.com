                    My work is currently ruminating on a conversation that ended and began with different concepts; from: a buildings architecture encapsulates an architectâ€™s vision of the future, which on completion becomes locked into the past; into: fate.

                <a>
                    If fate (a word I have difficulty discerning from the non-imminent future) is unknown and we are tied to the present, what is fate, is this the future; now, right then. Where does this impending belief begin?

                <a>
                    I believe this space of thought exists only in meditations, isolated in time determined by the past, fate, and our own inner mysticism.
