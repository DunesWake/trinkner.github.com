                My work is currently ruminating on a conversation that began and ended with different concepts; one: a buildings architecture encapsulates an architectâ€™s vision of the future, which on completion becomes locked into the past; two: fate. (These should not be mistaken as linear relationsips, acting rather as initial orbiting satallites)<br>
                <br> 
                If fate (a word I have difficulty discerning from the non-imminent future) is unknown and we are tied to the present, what is fate, is this the future; now, right then. Where does this impending belief begin?<br>
                <br> 
                I believe this space of thought exists only in meditations, isolated in time determined by the past, fate, and mysticism.<br>
